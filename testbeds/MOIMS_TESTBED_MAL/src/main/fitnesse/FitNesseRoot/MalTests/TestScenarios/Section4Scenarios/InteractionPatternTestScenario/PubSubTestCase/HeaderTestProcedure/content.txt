!4 Test procedure: header
This test procedure checks the MAL message header in every stage of the Pub/Sub interaction.
It is executed once for each !-QoS-! level, session. 
The session name depends on the session type. If the session type is Live, the name is 'LIVE'. If the session type is Replay, the name is 'R1'. If the session type is Simulation, the name is 'S1'.

The consumer creates subscriptions from the following parameters:
 * subscription identifier: 'sub1'
 * authentication identifier: '0x00,0x01'
 * priority: 1
 * domain: 'Test,Domain'
 * networkZone: '!-NetworkZone-!'
 * entity expression: 'A,null,null,null'
 * only on change: false
 
All the tests are executed once with a private broker and a second time with a shared one.
The shared broker is created one the consumer side because. In this way, it enables the test to intercept the messages going out of the provider's publisher.

Some headers are only checked with a shared broker:
 * Publish
 * Publish Register
 * Publish Register ack
 * Publish Register Error
 * Publish Deregister
 * Publish Deregister ack
 
 The Publish Error is triggered by publishing an entity that has not been registered: 'B,null,null,null'.
 The Publish Register Error is triggered by registering an entity which key is recognized by the test transport.
 The Notify Error is injected through the test transport module.
 
 The provider assertions are described in the IPTest service specification (section 5.1).
 The consumer assertions are described in annex B.
