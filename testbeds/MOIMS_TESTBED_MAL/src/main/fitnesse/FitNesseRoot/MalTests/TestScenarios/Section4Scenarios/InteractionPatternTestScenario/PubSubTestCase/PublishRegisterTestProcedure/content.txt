!4 Test procedure: publish register
This test checks that the !-EntityKeyList-! contained in a Publish Register is correctly interpreted by the broker.

The consumer triggers a Publish Register initiated by the provider.
Then it triggers a Publish also initiated by the provider.
Finally it checks whether the provider receives a Publish Error or a Notify message is received by the subscriber.
