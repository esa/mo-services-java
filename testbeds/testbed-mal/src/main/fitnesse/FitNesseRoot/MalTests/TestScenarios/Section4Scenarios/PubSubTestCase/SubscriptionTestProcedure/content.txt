!4 Test procedure: subscription
This test checks that a Pub/Sub registration correctly behaves:
 * Notified updates shall arrive only once even if several entity requests match the same entity
 * If the 'only on change' indicator is true then only 'CREATION', 'MODIFICATION' and 'DELETION' updates shall be received.
 * The Notify transaction identifier shall be equal to the first Register transaction identifier
 
 The consumer registers with the following parameters:
 * subscription identifier: 'sub1'
 * authentication identifier: '0x00,0x01'
 * priority: 1
 * domain: 'Test,Domain'
 * networkZone: '!-NetworkZone-!'
 * entity expression: 'A,null,null,null'
 * only on change: false
 
 The transaction identifier of the Register acknowledgement is stored.
 
 The consumer re-registers with the same parameters as before except:
 * only on change: true
 * two entity requests with the same entity expression: 'A,null,null,null'
