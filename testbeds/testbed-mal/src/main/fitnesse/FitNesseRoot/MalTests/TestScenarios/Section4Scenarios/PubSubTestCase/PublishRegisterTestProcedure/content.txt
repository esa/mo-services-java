!4 Test procedure: publish register
This test checks that the !-SubscriptionKey Names list-! contained in a Publish Register is correctly interpreted by the broker.

The consumer triggers a Publish Register initiated by the provider.
Then it triggers a Publish also initiated by the provider.
Finally it checks whether the provider receives a Publish Error or a Notify message is received by the subscriber.

This framework supports the use of a shared broker. However, this feature is rarely used in practice, as it brings unnecessary overhead in most of the cases.
Errors with encoding/transport may result from the shared broker configuration.
