!3 !-CompositeFilter-! structure test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the structure 'CompositeFilter' in the contexts of the operation 'query' and 'count' (when appropriate).

!4 Field name
* !-CompositeFilter-!.fieldName) The name of the field in the object body (MAL::Composite) to match against. It is specified by referring to the name of the field.
* !-CompositeFilter-!.fieldName) If the field does not exist in the Composite then the filter shall evaluate to false.
* !-CompositeFilter-!.fieldName) If the field is nested inside another Composite, it can be referenced by separating the field names by a '.' character; for example the field 'instId' or the source of an !-ArchiveDetails-! composite would be referenced using "details.source.key.instId". 
* !-CompositeFilter-!.fieldName) If the body is not a Composite but an Attribute or Enumeration then it can be referred to by using a blank ("") string value here.
* !-CompositeFilter-!.fieldName) Accessing values from lists is not supported by this method.
