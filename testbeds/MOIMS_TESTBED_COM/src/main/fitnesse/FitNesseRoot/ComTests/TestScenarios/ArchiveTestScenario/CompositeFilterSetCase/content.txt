!3 !-CompositeFilterSet-! structure test case
This tests each prescriptive statement defined for the structure 'CompositeFilterSet' in the contexts of the operation 'query' and 'count' (when appropriate).

!4 Composite filter set

* !-CompositeFilterSet-!) Contains a list of !-CompositeFilters-! that are AND'd together to form a more complex filter.
