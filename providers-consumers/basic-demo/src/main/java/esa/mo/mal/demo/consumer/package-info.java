/**
 * This package contains a simple demonstration application of a service consumer. 
 * The consumer displays updates from the provider on a simple grid and allows 
 * the registration for updates using either a wildcard or explicitly naming the
 * parameters. It also has menu items for the invocation of some simple operations 
 * supported by the provider to test basic interaction pattern handling of the 
 * transport which is useful for testing a new transport or encoding.
