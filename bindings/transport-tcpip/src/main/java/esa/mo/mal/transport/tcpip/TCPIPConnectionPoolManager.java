/**
 * The TCPIP Connection pool manager keeps a list of client sockets, uniquely
 * identified by port.
 *
 * This class handles the creation, retrieval and destruction of client sockets.
 * Each time a client requests a new socket to some provider, it requests it
 * from here. The connection pool manager either returns the socket if it
 * already exists, or creates a new socket, adds it to the list of sockets and
 * returns the socket to the client.
 *
 * The connection pool manager supports the creation of both sockets without a
 * predefined port, and sockets with a predefined port. In the former case, a
 * random ephemeral port number is assigned. In the latter case, a socket is
 * created with a predefined port. If this doesn't work because the port already
 * exists, the manager creates a socket with an ephemeral port number.
