!2 MAL message segmentation test scenario

*!
All test services are extensions of other MAL/SPP services and/or MAL services.

Message segmentation is tested using three providers and three consumers:
- APID qualifier/APID 248/2: DataTest service provider - configured to maximum packet size
- APID qualifier/APID 247/1: DataTest service consumer
- APID qualifier/APID 648/2: DataTest service provider - configured to limited packet size
- APID qualifier/APID 647/1: DataTest service consumer
- APID qualifier/APID 648/4: IPTest service provider - configured to medium packet size
- APID qualifier/APID 647/3: IPTest service consumer

The testData operation of the DataTest service is used to check proper sending and reception of
a Blob that encodes to a packet smaller than PACKET_DATA_FIELD_SIZE_LIMIT of 65536 bytes (the
maximum).

The testBlobData operation of the DataTest service is used to check proper sending and reception of
a Blob that encodes to three fully filled and one partially filled packet for the maximum possible
value of PACKET_DATA_FIELD_SIZE_LIMIT.

In both cases the Blob is statically known to the provider and consumer side.

The testStringData operation of the DataTest service is used with endpoints configured for a limited
packet data field size of 27 bytes. Three cases are tested:
- secondary header: 23 bytes; body: 2 bytes; one packet, no error expected.
- secondary header: 23 bytes + 4 bytes for counter (because of message segmentation); body: 6 bytes; INTERNAL error expected.
- secondary header: 24 bytes + 4 bytes for counter (because of message segmentation); body: 6 bytes; INTERNAL error expected.
Secondary header size is set by per-message QoS property flag Priority. All other flags (except
Source and Destination id flag) are set to false.

Correct sequencing of Space Packets is ensured by scrambling outgoing packets in certain patterns.
Packets are either scrambled on the consumer side, on the provider side or on both sides. In order
to enabling scrambling on the provider side the IPTest submitMulti operation is invoked with the
scramble pattern. Scrambling is realized in the packet interceptor by collecting packets for an
interval of one second starting with the first packet. These are scrambled according to a cyclic
pattern given by the test. This pattern gives the indices of the packets that shall be sent out
next. Indices referring to non-existent packets (because less packets were collected during the
interval) are skipped. A negative index means to drop the packet. For test purposes it is assumed
that a mission-defined timeout is longer than the one second collection interval.

The procedure to test for correct counter selection does not need to scramble packets. The
progressNulti operation of the IPTest service is used to check correct selection of segment counters
by invoking the pattern twice and triggering updates and responses using the sendMulti operation
of the same service. By invoking the pattern twice on the same service the only difference is in
the transaction id. It is checked that different counters are used, when transaction ids are
different and that same counters are used when all fields of clause 4.4.9e are the same.
