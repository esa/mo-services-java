!3 All IPs except Pub/Sub test case

Reuse the MAL test procedure that does the following actions:
 1 Call the operation <ip> provided by the IPTest service with the parameters passed to the test procedures: 'ip', 'qos', 'session' and 'transition list id'.
 2 Wait for the expected transitions to be done, except the faulty ones that are ignored.
 3 Check the message headers
 4 Check the transitions
 
 Several APIDs and APID qualifiers are used:
 - 248/2: IPTest providers sending TC packets
 - 348/4: IPTest providers sending TM packets
 - 247/1: IPTest consumers sending TC packets and expecting to receive TC packets
 - 347/3: IPTest consumers sending TC packets and expecting to receive TM packets
 - 447/5: IPTest consumers sending TM packets and expecting to receive TC packets
 - 547/7: IPTest consumers sending TM packets and expecting to receive TM packets

Body element encoding is checked for each interaction pattern and interaction stage.
