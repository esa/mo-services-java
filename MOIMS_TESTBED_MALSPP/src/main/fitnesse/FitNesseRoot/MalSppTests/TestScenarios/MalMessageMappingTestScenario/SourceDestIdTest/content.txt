!3 Source/Destination identifier test case

This test uses the Request interaction pattern in order to test that the source 
and destination identifiers can be omitted in the MAL message header fields 
'URI From' and 'URI To' and that the source and destination id flags are set to 
false in this case.

The consumer is configured in order not to append the optional identifier at the 
end of its URI. A TC/TC !-REQUEST-! interaction is initiated and the 
source/destination id flags are checked in the request and response 
MAL messages:
- the source id flag should be down in the request and up in the 
response.
- the destination id flag should be up in the request and down in the 
response.
