!4 Test procedure: header
Reuses the MAL prototype test procedure that checks the MAL message header in every stage of the Pub/Sub interaction.

However the Pub/Sub error tests could not be reused because the MAL prototype artificially produces error messages at the test transport
level, so above the MAL/SPP layer, preventing from getting the SPP packets. A specific broker handler has been implemented
in order to raise Register, Notify and Publish Register errors. This broker is deployed on the consumer side.
Specific providers and consumers have also been implemented.
A provider is launched on the consumer side in order to initiate a Publish Register with the error broker.

 Several APIDs and APID qualifiers are used:
 - 248/2: IPTest providers or brokers sending TC packets
 - 348/4: IPTest providers or brokers sending TC packets
 - 247/1: IPTest consumers, brokers and publishers sending TC packets and expecting to receive TC packets
 - 347/3: IPTest consumers, brokers and publishers sending TC packets and expecting to receive TM packets
 - 447/5: IPTest consumers, brokers and publishers sending TM packets and expecting to receive TC packets
 - 547/7: IPTest consumers, brokers and publishers sending TM packets and expecting to receive TM packets

The procedure is executed once for each !-QoS-! level, session. 
The session name depends on the session type. If the session type is Live, the name is 'LIVE'. If the session type is Replay, the name is 'R1'. If the session type is Simulation, the name is 'S1'.

The consumer creates subscriptions from the following parameters:
 * subscription identifier: 'sub1'
 * authentication identifier: '0x00,0x01'
 * priority: 1
 * domain: 'Test,Domain'
 * networkZone: '!-NetworkZone-!'
 * entity expression: 'A,null,null,null'
 * only on change: false
 
All the tests are executed once with a private broker and a second time with a shared one.
The shared broker is created one the consumer side because. In this way, it enables the test to intercept the messages going out of the provider's publisher.

Some headers are only checked with the shared broker (deployed on the consumer side):
 * Publish
 * Publish Register
 * Publish Register ack
 * Publish Register Error
 * Publish Deregister
 * Publish Deregister ack
 
 The Publish Error is triggered by publishing an entity that has not been registered: 'B,null,null,null'.
 
 The Register Error is triggered by registering to the error broker.
 
 The Publish Register Error is triggered by registering to the error broker.
 
 The Notify Error is triggered by requesting the error provider to publish updates.
 
 The MAL assertions are still checked:
 The provider assertions are described in the IPTest service specification (section 5.1).
 The consumer assertions are described in annex B.

The MAL/SPP assertions are specified in this script. They check the MAL header mapping statements 
for the Pub/Sub interaction:
- interaction type and stage
- is error

Body element encoding is checked for each interaction stage. Abstract element definitions are checked
by invoking monitorMulti operation instead of monitor. In this case the test updates are sent for the
abstract element and thus service-defined update types are tested. Non-service defined update types
are tested by publishing Integers to the special entity 'A,1,null,null'.
