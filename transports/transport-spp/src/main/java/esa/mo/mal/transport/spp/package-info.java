/**
 * An implementation of the transport interfaces for the SPP protocol. Builds 
 * upon the generic transport framework. It provides the classes needed for a 
 * real SPP based transport, there cannot be one supplied here as SPP is 
 * actuallya protocol rather than a message transport so requires another 
 * technology to move the messages from A to B.
 *
 * Derived transports that use SPP should ensure that only SPPMessages are 
 * created by overriding the correct methods in GENTransport.
